#We would use the features offered by AI, Machine Learning and data analytics for the task. By collecting the data of different factors such as rainfall, climate, humidity, moisture content, temperature variations, topography and the time frames at which the disasters have occurred over the years (data of past 100 odd years at least), we can come up with a pattern which helps us predict the different variables that ideally together may cause a natural disaster in that area.

By getting constant feed of data and images from satellites to analyse and predict weather, sea and wind patterns(to predict hurricanes), in case of even slight irregularity, we dig into that case and depending on intensity send out alerts/warnings to the target group.

 

Using pressure, GPS sensors, we can measure the distance between corresponding points of tectonic plates at regular time intervals. We can use seismographs to study the waves of an Earthquake. Analysing this continuous feed of data, in case of any sudden change/asymmetry, we can predict whether an earthquake/tsunami could occur by comparing it to the previous years’ data, noting the similarities it shows with the patterns of the seismographs. Any sudden change in the distance between any two tectonic plates is indicative of an earthquake/tsunami.

 

Using data collected from on ground equipment in case of extreme climate, wind pattern, low moisture content (analyse previous records for the target region, find a valid threshold temperature, humidity and moisture content). In case it exceeds that temperature, goes lower than that threshold humidity, an alert for a forest fire is a necessity.

 

In case of continuous/sudden heavy rainfall, we need to look at topography, collect and monitor human activities around flood prone areas (construction of dams, change in course of flow, deforestation can be a notable cause for floods, landslides, ecological imbalance)

 

RELIEF:

We decided to first start off with one particular target region and then expand our region of action. To begin with, we collect data for climate, topography, rainfall etc. and in addition also collect data such as the buildings in that location, their structure, the people using these buildings (target population), layout of the region etc. As soon as any warning is passed out by us, we know exactly which buildings, regions in and around these buildings that stand highest chance of damage and are not safe to be in and can immediately send out red alerts.

Using satellite imagery, we can find the closest viable location that is safe for temporary settlements and send out this location to people to make it much easier for them to evacuate.


Using visual recognition, we could take pre, post disaster photos for select natural disasters each year and their crowdsourcing platform will use micro-processing to accelerate damage assessment. This could also be used to relocate people to safer areas at that instant by studying the images. Also by doing this we can efficiently find the places that haven’t received help and direct the emergency services to these unattended areas.
